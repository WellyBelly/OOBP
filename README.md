### Assignement 1:








### Assignment 2:

  
   - Use this link to load the page: https://wellybelly.github.io/OOBP/Assignment_2/
   
  OR
  
   - Download/Clone the repo and run the web page from a web server, due to browser security restrictions the JSON file cannot be accessed otherwise.
   A simple way to do it:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed and then install a development server
   
    npm install -g http-server
    
   Then (from your terminal/console) go to the directory with the code/web page and run
   
    http-server
   Then you will see a list of IPs which can be used to access that server. As far as I know this is a purely local server so you don't neet to worry.
   To stop the server simply hit CTRL + C in the terminal/console and the server is stopped.
