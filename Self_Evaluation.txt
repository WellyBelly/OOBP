Self Evaluation


Assignment 1
  I have completed 100% of the exercise requirements.
  I would give 10 points out of maximum 10p.

  Here is a description of what I could improve on:
    * My code could be a little less repepetive and clearer.
    * Not all functions are pure (it wasn't a requirement but it would still be nice to have completely pure functions)


Assignment 2
  I have completed 100% of the exercise requirements.
  I would give 10 points out of maximum 10p.
  
  Here is a description of what I should improve on:
    * The methods are pretty messy and big. I should write smaller/less repetitive functions.
    * I should polish my HTML/CSS skills. Things are a little too clunky.
